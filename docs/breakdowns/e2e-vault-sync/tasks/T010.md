# T010 - Apply Background-Pulled Data Immediately After Vault Unlock

**Type**: FE
**State**: pending
**Phase**: Phase B - Client E2E Pull/Apply Pipeline

## Business Summary
If ciphertext was pulled while locked, unlocking should immediately reconcile local state.

## Logic
We support "background pull": ciphertext may already be stored in local encrypted storage. After a successful vault unlock, we should decrypt+apply those stored ciphertext records so the UI updates right away.

## Technical Logic
- In `hooks/useVaultUnlock.ts` after successful unlock + `setUnlocked(...)`, call `decryptAndApplyPulledE2eRecords(vaultKey)`.
- Ensure this is safe to run when there are no stored ciphertext records.

## Testing
Jest test:
- mock the decrypt/apply util
- assert it is called after a successful unlock

## Files
- **Modify**: `hooks/useVaultUnlock.ts`

## Patterns
- Reference other post-unlock actions in `hooks/useVaultUnlock.ts`.

## Dependencies
- T008 (decrypt/apply util)
- T007 (ciphertext persistence)
