# T002: Add `bulkDelete` to `useBookmarks` Hook

**Status**: `pending`

## Action
Modify

## Business Summary
Enable deleting multiple bookmarks in one operation with optimistic UI

## Logic
- Accept array of bookmark IDs as parameter
- Add all IDs to pendingDeletes Set for optimistic UI
- Call storage.deleteBookmarks() with all IDs
- Show success toast with count: "Deleted N bookmarks"
- Show error toast on failure: "Failed to delete bookmarks"

## Technical Logic
```ts
bulkDelete: (ids: string[]) => Promise<void>
// 1. Optimistic: add all to pendingDeletes
// 2. await storage.deleteBookmarks(ids)
// 3. Toast: "Deleted N bookmarks"
// 4. Handle errors with rollback
```

## Testing
Unit test:
- Deletes multiple bookmarks successfully
- Shows correct toast with count
- Handles partial failures (some succeed, some fail)
- Handles empty array
- Optimistic UI updates correctly (removed from list immediately)

## Files
- **Modify**: `hooks/useBookmarks.ts`
- **Modify**: `lib/storage.ts` (add deleteBookmarks function)

## Patterns
Similar to existing `deleteBookmark` but batched
