# T010: Wire Bulk Delete Confirmation

**Status**: `pending`

## Action
Modify

## Business Summary
Confirm before bulk delete using existing ConfirmDialog component

## Logic
- Click "Delete Selected" in BulkActionsBar opens ConfirmDialog
- Dialog shows "Delete N bookmarks? This cannot be undone."
- Confirm calls `bulkDelete(selectedIds)` then clears selection
- Cancel closes dialog
- Delete button should be red/destructive

## Technical Logic
```tsx
const [showBulkDeleteConfirm, setShowBulkDeleteConfirm] = useState(false)

<ConfirmDialog
  isOpen={showBulkDeleteConfirm}
  title={`Delete ${selectedCount} bookmarks?`}
  description="This action cannot be undone."
  confirmLabel="Delete"
  cancelLabel="Cancel"
  onConfirm={() => {
    bulkDelete(Array.from(selectedIds))
    clearSelection()
    setShowBulkDeleteConfirm(false)
  }}
  onCancel={() => setShowBulkDeleteConfirm(false)}
/>
```

## Testing
Visual check:
- Dialog appears when Delete Selected clicked
- Shows correct count in title
- Confirm button is red/destructive
- Confirm triggers delete and clears selection
- Cancel closes dialog without action

## Files
- **Modify**: `app/page.tsx` (or create separate `BulkDeleteConfirmDialog.tsx`)

## Patterns
Reuse existing `ConfirmDialog` from single delete flow

## Dependencies
- Requires T002 (`bulkDelete`) to be implemented first
- Requires T009 (`BulkActionsBar`) to be implemented first
