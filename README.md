# Bookmark Vault

Bookmark Vault is a private, distraction-free place to save and organize links you actually want to revisit.

## What it helps you do
- Capture links fast with titles, notes, and tags
- Group bookmarks into spaces like Personal, Work, or Research
- Find anything with search, filters, and sorting
- Save favorite views so you can return to the same context
- Preview pages at a glance with site info and thumbnails
- Clean up in batches with multi-select actions
- Bring links in or out with simple import and export
- Keep your collection private with optional sign-in and vault lock

## How people use it
- Build a research library for articles, papers, and videos
- Keep a project hub with the docs and references you need daily
- Organize personal reading lists without losing track
- Share exports with teammates or move collections between tools

## Homepage example (copy only)
Headline: Your bookmarks, finally under control
Subheadline: Save, tag, and organize links into focused spaces so you can find the right resource in seconds.
Primary CTA: Add your first bookmark
Secondary CTA: Import from another tool
Highlights:
- Spaces keep work and personal links separate
- Search and filters surface what you need fast
- Notes and tags add context for later
- Optional vault lock keeps everything private

1. Open the app and click Add bookmark.
2. Give it a title, URL, and optional notes or tags.
3. Use Spaces, Search, and Filters to keep everything tidy.
4. Import links from another tool whenever you are ready.
